# Enemies

Two types:

- Melee
- Ranged

We will first design 3 enemies of each type, with each of those enemies having 3 variants (differentiated by color) that will affect their difficulty.

## Melee

They will follow the player and attack them using weapons or bare hands.

## Ranged

They will keep a distance from the player, this distance will vary depending on the type of enemy.
